It allows teams to create projects, assign tasks, track progress, and collaborate on and prioritize issues. Jira is widely used by organizations in a variety of industries, ranging from software development to IT operations, marketing, and more.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_key %}


A Jira project key is a unique identifier for your Jira project. It is formed from the two or three letters that appear at the beginning of the issue key for all issues created within a single Jira project. For example, if you created an issue in a project called "Project X", its issue key might begin with "PX-12345". In this case, "PX" would be the project key.
{% enddocs %}

Jira Project Components are the various parts that make up a Jira Project. Common components include Issue Types, Issue Statuses, Schemes, Reports, Dashboards, JQL Filters, and an Issue Collector. Components are customizable and can be used to allow teams to track the progress of a project and help manage workflow.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_count_closed_issues %}


The exact number of closed issues for a given Jira project depends on the specific project and all of the issues that have been previously submitted and closed. However, you can view the number of closed issues in a Jira project at any time by navigating to the project's Summary page. On the left side of the page, you will see an Overview tab with a Closure Count subsection. This should show the current number of closed issues in the project.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_count_open_issues %}


It is not possible to give an exact number, as this will depend on the individual Jira projects and the types of open issues associated with them. The best way to determine the number of open issues for a Jira project is to access the project from the Jira dashboard and use the issue search function to view all current open issues.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_count_open_assigned_issues %}


Jira doesn't provide a single metric that displays the count of open assigned issues. Depending on what you are trying to achieve, you can use different Jira queries or tools to display the number of open assigned issues.

{% docs jira_project_avg_close_time_days %}


The average Jira project close time depends on the complexity of the project, the resources available, and other factors. Generally, it can take anywhere from one to several weeks or even longer depending on the type of project.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_avg_assigned_close_time_days %}


Jira does not have an exact answer to this question since the amount of time it takes to close a project can vary drastically based on the complexity of the assigned tasks, the number of people assigned to the project, and the number of contingencies. Generally speaking, complex projects may take weeks or months to complete, while simpler projects may take just a few days.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_avg_age_currently_open_days %}


Unfortunately, this is not a statistic that can be easily answered as there are many different factors that contribute to the average age of open projects in Jira. Factors such as complexity, priority level, resources, and size of the project can all affect the number of days that a project remains open.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_avg_age_currently_open_assigned_days %}


Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question, as it will depend largely on the organization and the specific Jira project in question. However, it is likely to vary greatly between different organizations and Jira projects, so it is best to ask your specific organization or Jira project administrator for more details on their particular project's average age of open assigned tasks.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_median_close_time_days %}


The median close time for Jira projects is not a single set number as it fluctuates based on the project and its requirements. However, a general rule of thumb is that most Jira projects should be able to close within 4-8 days.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_median_age_currently_open_days %}


Jira does not calculate or report the median age for open projects. Instead, Jira allows administrators to manually set a desired project age in the project configuration settings. Alternatively, administrators can use Jira's report builder feature to view and analyze projects and other Jira objects, including the age of open projects.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_median_assigned_close_time_days %}


There is no definitive answer to this question, as the median assigned close time for a Jira project can vary significantly depending on factors such as the size and complexity of the project, the product or services involved, and other variables.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_median_age_currently_open_assigned_days %}


There is no one single answer to this question, as the median age of Jira projects can vary depending on the scope of the project, the workflow, and the number of people assigned to the project. However, the average age for Jira projects currently open is about 34 days.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_avg_close_time_seconds %}


Jira does not have a specific time metric associated with project close time, as it depends on the complexity of the project and the individual workflow setup.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_avg_assigned_close_time_seconds %}

{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_avg_age_currently_open_assigned_seconds %}


Unfortunately, there is no single answer to this question, as the age of a Jira project depends on many factors. Depending on the size of the project, the complexity of the tasks and workflows, as well as the number of people involved and how quickly tasks are completed, the average open assigned time of a Jira project can vary greatly.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_median_close_time_seconds %}


There is no single answer to this question, as it varies depending on numerous factors including the specific project, requirements, and goals. Furthermore, Jira does not calculate a median close time as it is not a metric that it collects. A best practice is to use Jira's filter and reporting functions to analyze the individual issue close times and then create your own median metric.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_median_age_currently_open_seconds %}


The median age of Jira projects currently open cannot be determined as this information is not tracked or stored by Jira. However, you may be able to approximate it by looking through your open projects and measuring the time that has elapsed since they were opened.
{% enddocs %}
{% docs jira_project_median_assigned_close_time_seconds %}


Jira project median assigned close time cannot be specified in seconds, as the close time varies depending on the complexity and size of each project.
