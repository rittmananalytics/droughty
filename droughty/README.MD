**What is droughty?**

droughty is an analytics engineering toolkit. It takes warehouse
metadata and outputs semantic files.

Current tools and supported platforms are:

-   lookml - generates a lkml with views, explores and measures from a
    warehouse schema
-   dbt - generates a base schema from specified warehouse schemas.
    Includes standard testing routines
-   dbml - generates an ERD based on the warehouse layer of your
    warehouse. Includes pk, fk relationships
-   cube - generates a cube schema including dimensions, integrations
    and meassures

The purpose of this project is to automate the repetitive, dull elements
of analytics engineering in the modern data stack. It turns out this
also leads to cleaner projects, less human error and increases the
likelihood of the basics getting done\...
