Warehouse Support
=================

Droughty currently supports BigQuery and Snowflake. It uses the permissions assigned within the .profiles.yml file to access the warehouse meta-data. 

There are plans to expand coverage to include firebolt. I have thought about adding coverage for redshift but feel that providing tooling for a warehouse like redshift could further promote it's use and I find this unethical due to how awful it is.
